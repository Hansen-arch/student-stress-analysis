Data analysis project on student stress using IBM Granite AI, Google Colab, and Kaggle dataset.

Student Stress Monitoring Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes student stress monitoring datasets to identify patterns, correlations, and potential causes of stress. The goal is to generate **insights and recommendations**   that can support better decision-making in education and student well-being programs.  

The project uses Python for data analysis and **IBM Granite LLM** for AI-supported insights and recommendations.

Raw Dataset

  Dataset: [Student Stress Monitoring Datasets (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdsultanulislamovi/student-stress-monitoring-datasets)  

Analysis Process
  1. **Data Loading** → Import dataset from Kaggle.  
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Visualizations, correlation heatmaps, and descriptive statistics.  
  3. **AI-Assisted Analysis** → IBM Granite used to generate insights, findings, and recommendations from analytical results.  
  4. **Reporting** → Summarized results into insights, conclusions, and recommendations.  

Insights & Findings
  - High stress levels are strongly correlated with academic performance.  
  - Stressors such as **workload, exams, financial concerns, and social issues** contribute the most.  
  - Seasonal or time-based patterns suggest **peak stress before exams**.  

Conclusion & Recommendations
  - Institutions should **introduce stress management workshops**.  
  - Provide **accessible mental health resources** on campus.  
  - Consider **flexible scheduling** to reduce exam-related stress.  
  - Monitor stress data continuously to anticipate **peak stress periods**.  

AI Support Explanation
This project used **IBM Granite 3.3 8B Instruct** (via Replicate + LangChain) to:  
  - Summarize analysis results into insights.  
  - Generate logical findings from correlation and descriptive statistics.  
  - Provide **data-driven recommendations** for student stress management.  

The AI model acted as a **co-pilot**, helping transform raw analysis into clear, actionable insights.
